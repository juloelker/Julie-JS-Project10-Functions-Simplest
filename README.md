# Julie-JS-Project10-Functions-Simplest

This code is two ridiculously simple functions. One displays an alert in response to a click and the other is invoked immediately. Practice, practice, practice!

Updated the main branch on 3/11/2021.  The extended description explains how I fixed two issues. I feel encouraged that I can troubleshoot my own code independently,
a small victory.
